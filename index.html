        The name <a href="https://www.astonmartin.com/en/welcome" target="_blank">Aston Martin</a> is derived partly from the name of its founder, Lionel Martin, and partly for a stretch of road in Hertfordshire, England, used for racing, called the Aston Hillclimb. World War I briefly halted production, and afterward Aston Martin produced cars specifically for the racetrack, focusing on speed more than luxury. However, building competition cars proved to be a strain on finances, and Aston Martin changed hands several times until World War II. In 1947, tractor manufacturer David Brown purchased the company, and models built under Brown's ownership also included his initials -- DB

        German Engineer August Horch founded the company August Horch & Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG, in 1899. Due to misunderstandings among partners, Horch left the company and formed a new company, August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH in 1909. But what to call the new company? The old company retained the name Horch (meaning "listen" or "hearken" in German) so he chose the Latin translation instead - <a href="https://www.audi.com/en.html" target="_blank">Audi</a>. Within a few years, Horch had made the Audi name well known in Europe.

        Henry Ford founded the Ford Motors Company in 1903, in Detroit, Michigan. <a href="https://www.ford.com/" target="_blank">Ford</a> has left his first company Cadillac, and started his own car company with a $28,000 investment. He perfected the mass production of cars by introducing moving assembly lines. This gave him the edge to cut the cost and offer an affordable car to the American middle class. His famous mass production car of 1908, Model T, sold more than millions over the next 20 years. Later on, Ford made several acquisitions, including Volvo, Troller, and FPV brands.
